This is a personal blog. Actually, more of a diary. I want to share a few details about what I am up to. Not that I lead the most interesting life, but I do have my moments. In any case, the diary is more for me to reflect on the day. It is also fun to look back on old memories.

I used to have a similar site several decades ago. If I can find those pages, i will repost them here.
