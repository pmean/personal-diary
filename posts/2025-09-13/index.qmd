## 2025

The year is not done yet. Among the live movies, "The Life of Chuck" is my favorite. It's based on a Stephen King short story, but does not have the creepiness or gore that you might expect. Instead, it is a sweet and somewhat sad movie. The first third of the movie is somewhat confusing, especially if you did not read the story first.

For the virtual movie group, "Play It Again, Sam" is one of my favorites of all time. I saw it as a teenager and related very closely to the Woody Allen character who struck out repeatedly in the dating scene. The others in the movie group did not like it as well as I did, which is okay.

## 2024

The big movie of the year was "Wicked", but a sleeper that was actually quite good was "American Fiction". Two virtual movie group choices which have reached cult status are "Back to the Future" and "Ferris Bueller's Day Off".

## 2023

A Christmas film that rivals so many of the others, "The Holdovers", is the best among some very good live films. By popular demand for the virtual movie group, we rewatched something that we had seen several years before in the live movie group, "Big Sonia". This is a film that is hard to find, but well worth watching if you can find it.

## 2022

After a 19 month gap, we returned to watching live movies. It was nice to watch the big screen, and see everyone face-to-face again. Among the virtual movie group choices, "All of Me" stands out. Steve Martin plays a role where he has to physically act as a woman inhabiting inside a man's body, and his physical movements and gestures add greatly to the humor.

## 2021

In January, still in the depths of Covid isolation, the movie group members asked if we could meet twice a month. There certainly are enough movies out there to do this. My favorite film by far among the 24 we saw in 2021 is "Breaking Away". Many others might list "The Princess Bride" as their favorite film of all time.

## 2020

In March 2020, the Covid crisis had gotten serious enough to cancel the live movie group. We would not restart again until late in 2022. We switched to a virtual movie format in April. Several people in the group had trouble at first with getting Zoom to work, but after a few months, everything went smoothly.
