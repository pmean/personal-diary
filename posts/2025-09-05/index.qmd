Our movie group went to see a matinee showing of Hamilton. This is a direct recording of the Broadway musical, with the original cast members. If you are unfamiliar with "Hamilton," it is a retelling of the life of Alexander Hamilton, one of our founding fathers. The intriguing feature of this musical is the use of rap and hip-hop, mixed in with the more traditional Broadway musical style.

If you are not used to hip hop, the first few minutes are a bit disorienting. But you'll catch the swing of things soon enough. The story itself is fascinating, and pretty much all true. Every role is done well, but two stand out. There is quite a bit of humor when King George III takes the stage, and a very flamboyant Thomas Jefferson is a joy to watch.

I saw the stage version of Hamilton when it arrived in Kansas City a few years ago. The movie is pretty much a faithful reconstruction of the Broadway show. You get the benefit of seeing the original cast members, rather than the players in the tour.

Definitely try to see the live version if you can. You lose a bit watching in a movie theater, but the large screen and the close-ups are a plus. It does go on a bit long at almost three hours. If you can't see Hamilton live, definitely watch this. Rating 9 out of 10.
