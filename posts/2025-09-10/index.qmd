A relatively quiet day. I ran in the morning. Just a short run (1.2 kilometers), but it was good to recover from the 10 kilometer race over the weekend. My next race is the Kansas City Zoo run on September 20. It is a four mile race through three parts of the zoo, Africa, Australia, and Asia. I want to keep in reasonable shape, so I will try to run every other day or every third day.

I had a routine yearly checkup with Dr. Jenny Bailey about my sleep apnea. It is being treated well by the CPAP machine that I use every night. The machine records how long I sleep, about 5.5 hours on average. That doesn't seem like a lot but because the apnea is being treated well, 5.5 hours is more than enough. The CPAP machine records any apnea events (times when I stop breathing). There were none in the past month. Good for me.

Cathy and I watched a couple of episodes of Marlow Murder Club. This is a PBS Masterpiece Theater series is set in a charming small town with a gentle stream flowing past gorgeous mansions. I am envious of the person who has the job of scouting out places for a series like this.

Here is a picture of the cast members.

They use a term "cozy" for a series like this. I've never understood the term. After all someone dies very early and a variety of people reveal potentially murderous motivations throughout. I guess the term refers to the fact that they don't dwell on the gruesome aspects of the murder, but try to turn the murder into a puzzle.

I don't go into a series like this expecting to be smart enough to solve the case before the final 5 minutes of the last episode. Maybe you are smart enough to do this, but I am not. Instead I watch a series like this to enjoy the interesting characters and to be surprised at all the plot twists.

Marlow Murder Club is quite similar to a movie, Thursday Murder Club, that both Cathy and I saw a couple of weeks ago. Both Marlow and Thursday get seven stars out of ten.
