    "text": "I got up extra early and headed out for the 7:30am start of the Plaza 10K. The Plaza 10K is one of my favorite runs. It is a very scenic run. It starts near the Xian warrior statue on Ward Parkway. You head west along Ward Parkway almost to the state line, turning around right before Ward Parkway heads up a steep hill. Then you head back to the Plaza, cutting over to 47th Street which becomes Emmanuel Cleaver Boulevard. You run right past the shuttlecock sculptures at the Nelson Atkins museum and the Gates statue (Gates Barbecue, not Bill Gates). Keep going until just before the Bruce R. Watkins highway and come back along Brush Creek Parkway. You pass the gorgeous Stowers Institute and make a dog leg into the UMKC campus before returning to the Xian warrior statue again at the finish line.\nI am quite a bit out of shape and was slower than many of the walkers. I do take some pride in noting that I ran the whole way. Running is different than walking in that one foot leaves the ground before the other foot hits. It is a bit more vigorous. I could probably make better time by alternating running and walking, but that’s not for me. I did maintain the same pace throughout, roughly a 16 minute mile. My final time was 1:43:46. That placed me at 1,669 out of 1,720 runners, Even in my age group (Male 65-69) I was slow, finishing 17 out of 18. That’s okay.\nI was quite a bit sore afterwards. I felt it mostly in my hips, but my calf and thigh muscles also were quite weary.\nI weighed myself the next morning and was below 280 pounds, which I had not seen in a long time. I still have a long way to go towards my target weight of 200, but as they say, the journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step. Or in my case, a 10 kilometer run.\nHere is a map of the run.\n\nHere I am at the finish line.\n\nI started near the back of the pack, so the time displayed here is 3 minutes off."

    "text": "Our movie group went to see a matinee showing of Hamilton. This is a direct recording of the Broadway musical, with the original cast members. If you are unfamiliar with “Hamilton,” it is a retelling of the life of Alexander Hamilton, one of our founding fathers. The intriguing feature of this musical is the use of rap and hip-hop, mixed in with the more traditional Broadway musical style.\nIf you are not used to hip hop, the first few minutes are a bit disorienting. But you’ll catch the swing of things soon enough. The story itself is fascinating, and pretty much all true. Every role is done well, but two stand out. There is quite a bit of humor when King George III takes the stage, and a very flamboyant Thomas Jefferson is a joy to watch.\nI saw the stage version of Hamilton when it arrived in Kansas City a few years ago. The movie is pretty much a faithful reconstruction of the Broadway show. You get the benefit of seeing the original cast members, rather than the players in the tour.\nDefinitely try to see the live version if you can. You lose a bit watching in a movie theater, but the large screen and the close-ups are a plus. It does go on a bit long at almost three hours. If you can’t see Hamilton live, definitely watch this. Rating 9 out of 10."

    "text": "A relatively quiet day. I ran in the morning. Just a short run (1.2 kilometers), but it was good to recover from the 10 kilometer race over the weekend. My next race is the Kansas City Zoo run on September 20. It is a four mile race through three parts of the zoo, Africa, Australia, and Asia. I want to keep in reasonable shape, so I will try to run every other day or every third day.\nI had a routine yearly checkup with Dr. Jenny Bailey about my sleep apnea. It is being treated well by the CPAP machine that I use every night. The machine records how long I sleep, about 5.5 hours on average. That doesn’t seem like a lot but because the apnea is being treated well, 5.5 hours is more than enough. The CPAP machine records any apnea events (times when I stop breathing). There were none in the past month. Good for me.\nCathy and I watched a couple of episodes of Marlow Murder Club. This is a PBS Masterpiece Theater series is set in a charming small town with a gentle stream flowing past gorgeous mansions. I am envious of the person who has the job of scouting out places for a series like this.\nHere is a picture of the cast members.\n\nThey use a term “cozy” for a series like this. I’ve never understood the term. After all someone dies very early and a variety of people reveal potentially murderous motivations throughout. I guess the term refers to the fact that they don’t dwell on the gruesome aspects of the murder, but try to turn the murder into a puzzle.\nI don’t go into a series like this expecting to be smart enough to solve the case before the final 5 minutes of the last episode. Maybe you are smart enough to do this, but I am not. Instead I watch a series like this to enjoy the interesting characters and to be surprised at all the plot twists.\nMarlow Murder Club is quite similar to a movie, Thursday Murder Club, that both Cathy and I saw a couple of weeks ago. Both Marlow and Thursday get seven stars out of ten."
